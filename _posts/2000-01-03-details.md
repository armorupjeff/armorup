## Setup as user homepage

- Go click **fork** on the [github project page](https://github.com/t413/SinglePaged)
- Rename your new repository to `**username**.github.io`. (click settings in the right column)
- Clone your repository, **cd into the project**
- Run `git checkout publish && git branch -m master && git push -u origin master && git branch -D gh-pages` to get the *publish* branch as master for a clean, empty starting point.
- On your github project page go to *settings* again and change your **default branch** to ***master***
- Run `git push origin --delete gh-pages` to delete your remote's development branch

Now hop over to [Usage](#usage) to get it running with your own stuff!

**When you publish changes use `git push -u origin master`**
